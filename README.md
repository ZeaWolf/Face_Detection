"# Face_Detection" 
This project included a testingData folder and a trainingData folder.
They contain images for training and testing.

There are a IPYNB File and a Python File, named Face_Background_Classification. 
They both contain the same code.

Install Opencv using "!pip install opencv-python"
I would recommand open the IPYNB file using Jupyter NoteBook.

The GenerativeDiscriminativeModels_Report.pdf file is my report for this assignment.
